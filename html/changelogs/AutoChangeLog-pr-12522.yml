changes:
  - bugfix: Fixes the RBMK constantly increasing in heat and pressure
  - bugfix: The RBMK no longer makes the entire station uninhabitable if the engineers
      screw up
  - balance: Rebalances the RBMK gas, heat, and power interactions to make them more
      dependent on each other and generally more interesting to use
